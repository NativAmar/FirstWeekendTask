            Basset Hound
         </header>
         <p>
            The Basset Hound dog breed was bred for hunting small game such as rabbits and is still used for this purpose in some parts of the United States.
            When they’re not on the trail of a bunny, they’re laid-back family friends who love kids.
         </p>
          <p>
            Adaptable, affectionate, and relaxed, these dogs will even appeal to novice pet parents who are new to the dog world.
            You will, however, need to commit to at least moderate exercise and feed your pup an appropriate diet, as their easygoing demeanor could lead to weight gain and the health issues that can come with.
            If you can keep your Basset active, in spite of how much they may protest, you’ll have a loving companion who will stick around for many years to come.

         <p>
            Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike.
            Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds,
            they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.
        </p>
         <p>
            Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent.
            Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. 
            They’re still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States.
            But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.

                The Bugg is a mixed breed dog — a cross between the Boston Terrier and Pug dog breeds.
                Intelligent, affectionate, and spunky, these pups inherited some of the best traits from both of their parents.
           </p>
            <p>
                The Bugg is sometimes called the Pugin or simply the Boston Terrier Pug.
                Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed,
                you can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop!
            </p>

            <p>
                The Bulldog was originally used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting.
                Today, they’re gentle companions who love kids. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups.
                Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.
           </p>
            <p>
                A brief walk and a nap on the sofa is just this dog breed‘s speed.
                Bulldogs can adapt well to apartment life and even make great companions for novice pet parents.
                They’re affectionate with all members of the family and are fairly low-maintenance pups.
                Just make sure to keep them out of extreme weather, and also give them enough exercise,
                as weight gain is a risk with these dogs who are happy to spend most of the day on the couch.

            Border Collie

            <p>
                The Border Collie dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England.
                They’re known for their intense stare, or “eye,” with which they control their flock.
                They’re dogs with unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive, all of which make them a premier herding dog
                Border Collies are still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The highly trainable and intelligent, Border Collies also excel in various canine sports,
                including obedience, flyball, agility, tracking, and flying disc competitions.
                They can make for great family companions, so long as they get a lot — a lot! — of physical and mental exercise.
                You’ll also have to be comfortable with a dog who can outsmart you from time to time.
                If you want a loving, brainy dog who will keep you active and on your toes, this may be the breed for you!
