            Basset Hound

         <p>
            The Basset Hound dog breed was bred for hunting small game such as rabbits and is still used for this purpose in some parts of the United States.
             When they’re not on the trail of a bunny, they’re laid-back family friends who love kids.

            Adaptable, affectionate, and relaxed, these dogs will even appeal to novice pet parents who are new to the dog world.
             You will, however, need to commit to at least moderate exercise and feed your pup an appropriate diet, as their easygoing demeanor could lead to weight gain and the health issues that can come with.
              If you can keep your Basset active, in spite of how much they may protest, you’ll have a loving companion who will stick around for many years to come.

            Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike.
             Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.

            Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent.
            Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. 
            They’re still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States.
             But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.
